## Git vs. GitHub
*Git:*A version control system for programmers,  
you can track files & mods to them. This runs on the command line.  

**GitHub*:*A website that holds git repositories or repo.
This is important because you can backup your files, and visualy navigate them,
you can also collaborate with people like that.

## Initial Setup
Go to [the github website](www.github.com) and make an account. You need to have an Integrated Development Environment
or IDE to use the comand line and type in code. To maek an IDE go to this [Link](https://github.com/hstatsep/ide50) and follow the directions.

## Repository Setup
Now its time for your first repo. Open up both you IDE and your github account. Inside your IDE you need to make a folder to initilize.
Using the comand _mkdir (folder name)_ will make a new folder. Change Directorys or cd into the new folder with _cd (folder name)_
Next use the command _git init_ will initilze the repo preparing you for adding it to github. Use _touch README.md_ to make a file inside
that directory. Use _c9 README.md_ to open the file. Next type something inside the file, and type _git add README.md_ inside the termanl.
Use _git commit -m "insert messege here"_ to bring it to your remote.
